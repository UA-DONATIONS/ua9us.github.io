## Why we have to mark our donations

Thousands of people lost their life in this war, civilian and military. They need a lot of different things to survive and fight and we do everything possible to provide them what they need.

Nevertheless, there are also people, who make money on suffering, who steal and sell this free help, from food to night vision scopes and body armor. Unfortunately, this is the problem of each and every country and each and every historical period.

**That's why each item which is sent to Ukraine must be marked, to prevent this steal and sell.**

## How to mark

Simplest way is to add **short mark**, which is actually the site URL with warning and additional information, e.g. **[UA9.US](/alert/generic)**, **[MIL9.US](/alert/military)** or **[CIV9.US](/alert/civil)**   

_These sites will work no less than 3 years after the war and will be used solely to provide warnings and information about markings._

> **[UA9.US](/alert/generic)** - free help for civilian and military people and organizations
- Sell or distribution in exchange of any forms of compensation is prohibited
- Use of posession outside of Ukraine is prohibited


> **[MIL9.US](/alert/military)** - безкоштовна допомога **тільки** (без виключень) для Збройних Сил України  
- Sell or posession and use by the person who is not is active duty of Military Forces of Ukraine is prohibited
- Use of posession outside of Ukraine is prohibited


> **[CIV9.US](/alert/civil)** - безкоштовна допомога **тільки** (з виключеннями) для цивільних людей та установ
- Sell or distribution in exchange of any forms of compensation is prohibited
- Use of posession outside of Ukraine is prohibited
- Use by Military Forces of Ukraine is legal, but it is advised to contact us to help to understand issues with aid distribution.

Also there is a sense to add additional information, like source or serial number.

## Marking Type I - Basic

Just add **[UA9.US](/alert/generic)** or **[MIL9.US](/alert/military)** or **[CIV9.US](/alert/civil)**, according to the item type.

My recommendation - military gear (helmets, armor, scopes, weapon accessories, clothes etc.) should be marked with **[MIL9.US](/alert/military)** only. Everything else, in case of doubts, **[UA9.US](/alert/generic)**.

**For example**, all my flashlights for Military Forces of Ukraine will be marked like 
> MIL9.US

## Marking Type II - Origin

Sometimes volunteer or manufacturer, who donated an item, want to add some source identifier. **You can use any approach, but I'd recommend to use code of origin.**

For example, all my helmets for Military Forces of Ukraine will be marked as
>MIL9.US  
>SOT


All known to me codes with contact information are [here](/read/sources) and **SOT** is one of them.

**If you want to add your own code to this [list](/read/sources) - send me email to [code@ua9.us](mailto:code@ua9.us)** with a code and contact information.


## Marking Type III - Serial number

Serial number is any identifier which you can add to your origin code after hyphen.

For example
> MIL9.US  
> SOT-AKMI123BR

or even some sentence (which is not a good serial number IMHO)
> CIV9.US  
> SOT-Ukraine will win  
  
#### _Possible meanings of serial number (examples)_

Only you can say what is the meaning of your serial number. But I can share my examples.

> Item type - **SOT-W**, water packs  
> Item model - **SOT-B55MIL**, Mil-Tek backpack, 55 liters  
> Item type and destination - **SOT-AKMI123BR**, scope mount MI for АК, which was sent to batallion 123
> Individual serial number - **SOT-RD14**, Red Dot scope, individual number 14
  
#### _Symbols allowed_

I'd **recommend** to use alphabet, numbers and hyphen only.
  
#### _How to record your serials_

You should keep records of your serials and shipments, if you want to be able to track this item.

Also you can send me your serial numbers with description to be added to [serials page](/read/serials). Send me an email to **[code@ua9.us](mailto:code@ua9.us)**.
