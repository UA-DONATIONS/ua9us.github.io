## Code of origin

Manufacturers or suppliers may add information about them to this site. Or may not.

Here is all **known to me** [codes of origin](/mark/sources) with the contact information. So, there is no any guarantee that I know an origin, if it was not provided to me.

## Serial number

Serial number - it is any identifier which is added to a code of origin after hyphen. 

Only person who added it (origin) can tell the meaning of it and have corresponding records.

If serial number and description was sent to us, it can be found on the [serial numbers page](/mark/serials) with all the additional information. Otherwise, try to contact [origin](/mark/sources) (if this information available, of course).
